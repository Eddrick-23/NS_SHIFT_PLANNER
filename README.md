- **Ensure the appropriate locations are set.** If the location is the same as the database. A green box is shown. If the location is different, the location will be displayed in the corresponding time block also highlighted in green
- Shift sizes are allocated in either 30 min or 1h blocks
    -  First 30 min allocates xx00 - xx30 hrs
    - Last 30 min allocates xx30 to xy00 hrs
    - Full allocates xx00 - xy00 hrs

### Shift Checking algorithms
- Lunch/Dinner break checks
    - If someone is not allocated a lunch or dinner break. The name will be highlighted in <span style="color:red">RED</span>
    - Lunch break: **1130-1330 hrs** Dinner break: **1700-1830 hrs**
    - A person must be have at least a **30 min break** in the respective time periods for their name to not be highlighted
- Shift validation
    - At the bottom of the main page there are 3 columns Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3.
    - The validation activates only when all shifts are allocated I.e. Day 1: 56hrs allocated, Day 2: 60 hrs allocated, Day 3: 21hrs allocated.
    - validation checks that there are 2 people mounting in each control centre at the same time. And also at least 3 people for HOTO @ 0600-0700 on day 3.
